A simple modern Web-Mail UI, using HTML5 and Tornado for real-time interactions.

Aims of this project
--------------------

PMail aims to be a modern real-time webmail client, with focus on:

* Correct and safe handling of Rich Text
* Real-time updating of web interface
* Compatibility with a wide range of browsers
* Security
* Privacy

To start off, it will only include a built in SMTP server, later on it could be expanded to work with something like Postfix.
